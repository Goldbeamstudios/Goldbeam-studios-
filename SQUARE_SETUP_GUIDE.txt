IMPORTANT SETTINGS FOR ALL SERVICES
-----------------------------------
1. Online Booking: Bookable by customers online (MUST BE CHECKED).
2. Location: Ensure "The Goldbeam Studio" is selected.
3. Pricing: Always use "Fixed" price type unless it's a quote.
4. Assigned Team Members: Make sure yourself or a "Studio Resource" is assigned to the service.

NEXT STEP:
Once you save these, go to: Appointments > Online Booking > Channels > Service-specific links. 
Copy each link (e.g. for Studio A - Oasis) and paste them here for me!
I will make the buttons on the Studio page "smart" so they link to the exact theme the user is looking at.
